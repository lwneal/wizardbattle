![Wizard Battle](static/wizardbattle.gif)

In Wizard Battle, you are a wizard and you cast spells. What spells can you cast? Anything. Throw a fireball, transform into a moose, teleport your opponent to the bottom of the ocean. Anything you can think of, just type it in.


A tiny game, meant to test the concept of competitive real-time creative writing using a large language model.
